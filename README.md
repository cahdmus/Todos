# Todos
(Part of The Odin Project) Making a to-do app 

## Check list
- [x] Make this read me (hehe)
- [ ] To-do items (objects) with at least these properties : title, description, dueDate and priority. Optional: notes, checklist
- [x] Different "projects" to put the to-do items in
- [ ] Default project (when we first open the app)
- [x] Seperate modules for logic part of the app (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) and for the DOM-related stuff
- [x] View all projects
- [ ] View all todos in each project
- [ ] Expand a single todo to see/edit its details
- [ ] Delete a todo
- [ ] Add some persistence using the Web Storage API (localStorage)
